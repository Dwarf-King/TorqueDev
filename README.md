January 15, 2014 - I'm surprised at how many people still use this software, and I am very happy to have been able to contribute something like it to the world. Many people have asked me over and over to release the source code, but I was hesitant to do so due to a number of issues. I've finally decided to do just that, however. On the download page you can grab the latest build, along with the corresponding source code. http://www.torquedev.com

The source is being released under the GPL. Please do remember that it's ugly; I was about 19 when I coded it and it was my first major project in C#. Whatever you do with it, have fun.

The latest install package has removed a bunch of useless things, like the licensing system, auto updater, and stuff like that. It's the last and final "official" release of this software. Please do not contact me about support for either the software or the source code. If you do decide to release your own build because you made significant changes to make it better, feel free to let me know!

In today's development environment, it's crucial that developers be able to utilize the best tools available to accomplish their tasks. Today's world is about results, and TorqueDev helps you achieve those results. Created for coders, by coders, TorqueDev is a fully-fledged integrated development environment. It includes member completion on both the object and variable level, and Infopop™ tooltips for function completion.

Intellicode™ technology helps you find errors before you run your program. The Snippeter™ helps you organize re-usable blocks of code and share them with one click. Hundreds of developers in dozens of countries around the world have used Codeweaver and have been satisifed. Give it a try. We promise you won't be sorry.

## Getting it working

    Unzip the source code
    Open the Visual Studio project
    Go to the Build menu and click Build solution
    Navigate to the bin (release or debug) directory where the executables are.
    Copy the contents of the SHIP_STRUCT folder into the the bin (release or debug) folder where the executables are. (Note: you aren't copying the SHIP_STRUCT folder itself, since that's already there; copy the contents, including all subfolders, into the appropriate bin directory. For example: BIN\Debug\SHIP_STRUCT to BIN\Debug)

## A personal note

The code is super ugly. It was started something like ten years ago when I was 19 and it was my first major project in a language I had only moderate experience in. Originally it was just for me, to learn Torque and get the hang of the language, which I felt was pretty complex with only Notepad as a coding platform. My friend encouraged me to post it on the GarageGames forums and it sort of took off from there. So please keep this colorful history in mind as you read my terrible comments from my teenage years. Cheers!
