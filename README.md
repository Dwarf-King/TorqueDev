# TorqueDev

January 15, 2014 - I'm surprised at how many people still use this software, and I am very happy to have been able to contribute something like it to the world. Many people have asked me over and over to release the source code, but I was hesitant to do so due to a number of issues. I've finally decided to do just that, however. On the download page you can grab the latest build, along with the corresponding source code.

The source is being released under the GPL. Please do remember that it's ugly; I was about 19 when I coded it and it was my first major project in C#. Whatever you do with it, have fun.

The latest install package has removed a bunch of useless things, like the licensing system, auto updater, and stuff like that. It's the last and final "official" release of this software. Please do not contact me about support for either the software or the source code. If you do decide to release your own build because you made significant changes to make it better, feel free to let me know!
